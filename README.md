# Fullsend

A living design document exploring fully autonomous agentic software development for GitHub-hosted organizations.

## What is this?

This repo is a living design document exploring how to get from the current state of human-driven software development to a fully-agentic workflow with zero human intervention for routine changes. The goal is agents that can triage issues, implement solutions, review code, and merge to production autonomously — while being secure by design.

This is not a product spec. It's an evolving exploration of a hard problem space, applicable to any organization considering autonomous agents for their software development lifecycle. The problem documents are organization-agnostic; organization-specific considerations live in `docs/problems/applied/`.

## How to contribute

Pick a problem area that interests you. Read the existing document. Add your perspective, propose solutions, poke holes in existing proposals. Open a PR.

If you want to run an experiment — try an agent workflow in a repo, test a security guardrail, prototype an intent system — document what you did and what you learned in https://github.com/fullsend-ai/experiments.

If you're applying fullsend to your own organization, consider adding your specific considerations to `docs/problems/applied/` — your experience and feedback will strengthen the general problem documents.

### Where does my contribution go?

| If you have... | Then... |
|---|---|
| A question, bug, or small suggestion | **File an issue** — lowest friction, can graduate later. |
| A new problem area no existing doc covers | **Create a problem doc** in `docs/problems/` and link it here. |
| More to say about an existing problem area | **Expand the existing problem doc.** |
| A specific decision that needs a yes-or-no answer | **Propose an ADR** in `docs/ADRs/` via a pull request ([see ADR 0001](docs/ADRs/0001-use-adrs-for-decision-making.md)). |

When in doubt, start with an issue.
